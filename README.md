Implementation of ASAM MDF in Rust

The aim of this project is to make an open source implementation of an ASAM MDF reader and writer in Rust, based on [asammdf](https://github.com/danielhrisca/asammdf) that can interface with C/C++, Python and other languages through FFI. This should be a performant library that can be used widely and reliably.
